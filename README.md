## PCC tool and middleware

The Power Conversion Configurator (PCC) tool is a software-ready solution that demonstrates application-oriented power converters and makes the firmware ready to users. The aim of the tool is to save design/R&D time of the user and provide an ecosystem to quickly develop power conversion solutions. It is an intuitive tool that allows the firmware generation needed for control systems in the context of power converters with just a few mouse clicks. 

The tool currently supports buck converter designing in various configurations, including single-instance and multi-instance topologies, operating in both voltage control mode (VCM) and peak current control mode (PCCM). It generates coefficients for 2p2z and 3p3z compensators based on the converter parameters.

The power conversion middleware provides a library of compensators using different power converter topologies; it also provides personalities to work with the device configurator and PCC tool. By using the power conversion middleware personalities, the device configurator and PCC tool generate customized firmware, ensuring a seamless and efficient design process.

The power conversion middleware and the PCC tool work together. In this code example, the middleware is added to the project and the configuration is updated with the PCC tool and device configurator to work as a PCCM multi-instance buck converter.


## Design and implementation

This code example is intended to be used with the PSOC&trade; Control C3M5 Complete System Dual Buck Evaluation Kit. Two synchronous buck converters are available on the dual buck evaluation board provided with the kit. The buck converters on the dual buck evaluation board can be used in multiple configurations, such as single-phase, multi-phase, and multi-instance. This code example demonstrates the multi-instance configuration. 

This code example converts a DC 24 V input provided to the dual buck evaluation board from the wall adapter to a stable DC 5 V output. Two instances of the PWM available with the chip drives the gates for the two buck converters. Another instance of the PWM is used for transient load testing at a frequency of 1 Hz (on time - 30% and off time - 70%). The ADCs and the comparator and slope generator (CSG) available with the high-performance programmable analog subsystem (HPPASS) are used in the feedback path.

During peak current control, the output voltage is regulated by two essential loops:

- A digital voltage control loop executed at a defined control frequency which updates the peak current reference. 

- An analog current control loop based on DAC and comparator provided in the analog peripheral of the PSC3M5 device.

A 2P2Z compensator implemented in the firmware controls the outer voltage loop. It calculates the initial and final values for the slope generator in the CSG in all PWM cycles based on the measured output voltage and writes the results to the CSG registers. To achieve this, the PWM triggers an ADC read every PWM cycle. The ADC reads the output voltage level and triggers an interrupt. The compensator runs within the interrupt service routine (ISR). As this implementation is multi-instance, two ADC groups are used for reading the output voltage from buck 1 and buck 2 converters. These two groups are triggered by the respective PWMs on their terminal count.

The inner current loop is controlled by the CSG available with HPPASS. The inductor current captured through a current transformer is fed directly to the comparator of the CSG as one input. The comparator compares it with the reference generated by the internal DAC and modulates the PWM. 

The cycle-by-cycle current loop provides a good response for fast load transients. However, this becomes unstable with a duty cycle of over 50 percent. To avoid this, slope compensation is added to maintain an average current waveform and avoid instability. To enable slope compensation, the CSG can generate the slope from the initial and final values calculated by the compensator.

Three LEDs (STATUS LED, ACT LED, and FAULT LED) and a user button are available on the kit. Out of the three LEDs, ACT LED and FAULT LED are on the dual buck evaluation board while the STATUS LED is on the control card.

The user button can be used to switch the converter between different states. Behavior of the converter and the LED status are shown in **Figure 19** of the [Firmware states](#firmware-states) section.

The dual buck evaluation board integrates two onboard transient and variable load circuits, providing individual load control for each buck circuit. A single pole double throw (SPDT) switch, SW4 for buck 1 and SW5 for buck 2, provides easy selection between transient and variable load circuits, enabling flexible load management.

To perform the transient load test, it is required to keep the SPDT switch in transient mode and the same for the variable load test. The transient load circuit enables seamless load switching between 0.2 A and 1.8 A. Control for this circuit is managed by a 3.3 V PWM waveform from the PSOC&trade; C3M5 controller.

The variable load circuit supports load variation from 0.2 A to 1 A, controlled by potentiometers R42 for buck 1 and R61 for buck 2. The load can be increased by rotating the potentiometer clockwise and decreased by rotating it anti-clockwise.

**Figure 4** shows the block diagram of PCCM with a multi-instance converter.

**Figure 4. Block diagram - PCCM multi-instance**

![](images/pccm_block_diagram.png)

One of the most prominent features of PSOC&trade; Control C3M5 devices is the comprehensive interconnectivity matrix within on-chip peripherals. The HPPASS and TCPWM modules are highly interconnected; the conversion can be run completely in the background. The start of the conversion is triggered when the terminal count of the TCPWM counter occurs. Once the conversion result is available, an interrupt service request is activated, and the outer voltage loop function is executed in software (2P2Z compensator) within the ISR.

**Figure 5** shows the PCCM timing diagram.

**Figure 5. PCCM timing scheme**

![](images/pccm_timing_diagram.png)

During the ON time of the PWM, the inductor current rises. When this current reaches the peak current reference level, the PWM ON time period is terminated by a trigger from the CSG. The output voltage is sampled periodically; any difference with the reference voltage is compensated for and supplied as the peak current reference.


### Compensator

The compensator adds the required mechanism for helping the system output to track a desired reference input even in the presence of noise, modeling error, or disturbances. A Type-2 (2 poles, 2 zeros) filter is one of the most common types of feedback controllers used in peak-current-controlled buck converters. The poles and zeros of the compensation networks are placed according to the analysis of the control-to-output transfer function.

**Figure 6** shows the transfer function (H(z)) used in the compensator.

**Figure 6. Compensator transfer function** 

![](images/2p2z_eq_1.png)

**Figure 7** shows the transfer function in a linear difference equation.

**Figure 7. Linear difference equation** 

![](images/2p2z_eq_2.png)

Where x[n] = reference – feedback

In firmware, the 2P2Z filter is implemented using floating-point variables in the `mtb_pwrconv_2p2z_float_process` function. **Figure 8** shows the firmware implementation.

**Figure 8. 2P2Z filter** 

![](images/2p2z_filter.png)

This function takes an argument of types `mtb_stc_pwrconv_reg_2p2z_float_dat_t` and `mtb_stc_pwrconv_reg_2p2z_float_cfg_t`, which are structure types containing elements for keeping the compensator coefficients, intermediate filter values, range values, and the output. The filter is initialized with the coefficients when the converter is started. **Figure 9** shows the structure implementation.

**Figure 9. 2P2Z filter structure** 

![](images/2p2z_filter_structure.png)

The `mtb_pwrconv_2p2z_float_process` filter function is called from the ISR; it is triggered by HPPASS after the completion of the ADC conversion in each PWM cycle.

The compensator, shown in **Figure 9**, calculates the initial and final values for the CSG unit; these values are updated in registers `HPPASS_CSG_SLICE_DAC_VAL_A` and `HPPASS_CSG_SLICE_DAC_VAL_B`.

- Input voltage: 24 V
- Output voltage: 5 V
- Switching frequency: 300 kHz
- Control loop frequency: 300 kHz (control loop divider = 1)
- Crossover frequency: 6 kHz
- Phase margin: 60 degrees
- Pure time delay: 2

**Figure 10** shows the coefficients used in the code.

### Buck converter configuration

This section shows the code example configuration in the device configurator and PCC tool.

1. In the **Solutions** tab of the Device Configurator, create two buck converter instances with the **+** symbol and select the checkboxes for the configuration as shown in **Figure 12**.

   **Figure 12. Buck 1 configuration**

   ![](images/buck1_configuration.png)

2. Additionally, **Figure 12** shows the option to open the PCC tool, select the **Launch Power Conversion Configurator** tab to open the PCC tool.

3. The **Converter** tab in **PCC** tool lets you to select the buck converter parameters, such as **Input voltage**, **Output voltage**, and **Inductor value** configurations as shown in **Figure 13**.

   **Figure 13. Buck 1 PCC tool converter configuration**

   ![](images/buck1_pcc_converter.png)

4. The **Modulator** tab lets you to select the dead-time between PWMs and blanking time for the compensator as shown in **Figure 14**.

   **Figure 14. Buck 1 PCC tool modulator configuration**

   ![](images/buck1_pcc_modulator.png)

6. The **ADC** tab lets you to configure **ADC**, **External gain**, and **Protection limits** configurations as shown in **Figure 15**.

   **Figure 15. Buck 1 PCC tool ADC configuration**

   ![](images/buck1_pcc_adc.png)

7. The **Controller** tab lets you to configure the **RAMP**, **Post-processing**, and **Pre-processing** functions, which are executed at the same frequency as the control algorithm. The tool offers the possibility to create a user-defined control algorithm by selecting the **Custom Control Loop** block. **Figure 16** shows the controller configuration.

   **Figure 16. Buck 1 PCC tool controller configuration**

   ![](images/buck1_pcc_controller.png)

**Figure 17** shows the code preview for buck 1 ISR. The tool will generate a similar code for buck 2 also.

   **Figure 17. Code preview of Buck1 ISR**

   ![](images/code_preview_buck_isr.png)

The configuration for the second instance of the buck converter is shown in **Figure 18**. Other PCC configurations remain the same.

**Figure 18. Buck 1 PCC tool controller configuration**

![](images/buck2_configuration.png)


The PCC tool has the option to enable callbacks before and after executing the compensator. You can provide the name of the callback functions in the device configurator and PCC tool. As these functions are being called from the ISR, where the control loop is running, the functions must be defined as static inline functions to achieve optimal performance. The device configurator even gives you the option to name the header file. When the code is generated, it will include the header file in the generated files and add calls to the user functions from the ISR. These callback functions can be used for implementing features like overvoltage or overcurrent protection.

In this code example, using a function called as **buck2_pre_process_callback** as shown in **Figure 18**.

> **Note:** See the PCC tool and middleware documentation for more information.


### Protection and soft start implementation

Protection mechanisms are implemented to avoid the system operating beyond a limit. Input voltage, output voltage, output current, and temperature are checked, ensuring the system is not damaged by operating beyond the values it could run.

Currently, the following values are set as the range:

- Input voltage lower limit: 12 V
- Input voltage upper limit: 42 V
- Output voltage lower limit: 4 V
- Output voltage upper limit: 6 V
- Output current upper limit: 3 A
- Board temperature upper limit: 75 degrees celsius

The protection logic runs within a callback function from the ISR, which is triggered by HPPASS in every PWM cycle. The moving average of the output voltage, input voltage, output current, and temperature is calculated. If any one of the values go out of the predefined range, a fault condition is triggered and the PWM is terminated. The FAULT LED glows to indicate the fault condition. 

In addition to the protection implementation, soft start is implemented to ensure that the output voltage ramps up gradually from zero on startup. An additional timer is used to implement this feature; it runs at 100 Hz and triggers interrupts at the terminal count. The soft start logic is implemented inside this ISR by gradually increasing the output reference value for the compensator. After the completion of soft start, the timer is disabled; interrupts are not generated afterward.


### Firmware states 

During startup, the firmware initializes the peripherals and configures the interrupt, and then waits for button interrupts. When it is pressed, the state machine switches between different states and turning ON and OFF of the converter, transient test pulses, LED, and more will take place. See **Figure 19** for more details.

**Figure 19. State machine** 

![](images/state_machine.png)

As **Figure 19** shows, the four states are implemented. During startup, the state machine is in the "Idle" state. When the button is pressed, it switches between the different states as shown in **Figure 19**. When a fault is detected by the firmware, it immediately switches to the "Fault" state and disables the converter and transient testing pulses. The converter can be restarted by pressing the user button again.


### Reconfiguring the project

If you want to reconfigure the project as a single instance buck converter, then follow these steps:
1. Disable the second instance from the device configurator.
2. Delete the code added for the second instance marked with the comment **buck2** in the source code.
